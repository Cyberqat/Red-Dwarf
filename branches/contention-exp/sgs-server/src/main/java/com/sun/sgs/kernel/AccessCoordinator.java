 * any transaction on any node. An example would be a {@code ManagedObject}
 * as provided by the {@code DataService}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations should assume that each given {@code AccessReporter} will
 * report on a unique set of objects. That is, even if two different
 * {@code AccessReporter} instances report access to an object with the
 * same identifier, it should be assumed that these are different objects.
 * Think of each {@code AccessReporter} as reporting on objects within a
