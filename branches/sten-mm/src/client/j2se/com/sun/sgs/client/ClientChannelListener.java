 * {@link ClientChannelListener#receivedMessage receivedMessage} method is
 * invoked with the channel, the sender's session identifier, and the
 * message. A {@code null} sender indicates that the message was sent
 * by the server. The listener is <i>not</i> notified of messages that its
 * client sends on its associated channel.</li>
 * <li> When the associated client leaves a channel, the listener's
 * {@link ClientChannelListener#leftChannel leftChannel} method is invoked
 * with the channel. Once a client has been removed from a channel, that
 * client can no longer send messages on that channel.</li>
