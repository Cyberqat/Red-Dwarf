/**
 * Interface representing a communication group, a {@code Channel},
 * consisting of multiple client sessions.  Classes that implement
 * {@code Channel} must also implement {@link Serializable}.
 *
 * <p>A channel is created by invoking the {@link
 * ChannelManager#createChannel ChannelManager.createChannel} method
 * with a {@link Delivery} requirement.  A {@link ClientSession} can
 * be added or removed from a channel using that {@code Channel}'s
 * {@link #join(ClientSession) join} and
 * {@link #leave(ClientSession) leave} methods respectively.
 * All client sessions can be removed from a channel by invoking
 * {@link #leaveAll leaveAll} on the channel.
 *
 * <p>The server can send a message to all client sessions joined to a
 * channel by using the {@link #send send} method.  Note that the
 * methods of this interface are invoked within the context of an
 * executing {@link Task}; as a result, a message sent to client
 * sessions using the {@code send} method will not be sent until after
 * its corresponding task completes.  Messages sent on a channel will
 * be delivered according to that channel's {@link Delivery}
 * requirement, specified at channel creation time.
 *
 * <p>A client session joined to one or more channels may become
 * disconnected due to the client logging out or due to other factors
 * such as forced disconnection or network failure.  If a client
 * session becomes disconnected, then that client session is removed
 * from each channel that it is a member of.
 *
 * <p>When the application is finished using a channel, the
 * application should invoke that channel's {@link #close close}
 * method so that its resources can be reclaimed.  Once a channel is
 * closed, any of its side-effecting operations will throw {@link
 * IllegalStateException} if invoked.
 *
 * <p>If the application removes a {@code Channel} object from the
 * data manager, that channel will be closed.
 *
 * <p>TODO: modify class documentation to note that an application should
 * not remove a channel object, and that attempting to remove the channel
 * object (by invoking {@code DataManager.removeObject}) will throw
 * IllegalStateException.  If a channel is no longer needed, the
 * application should close the channel by invoking the {@link #close
 * close} method, and at some point later on, the channel object will be
 * removed by the channel manager.
