/**
 * This utility class provided by the kernel is used to run tasks. Unlike the
 * scheduler, which accepts tasks to run at some point in the future,
 * <code>TaskHandler</code> is the facility that actually invokes tasks.
 * It is needed to set the owner of tasks and create transactional context
 * for transactional tasks.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class enforces a singleton pattern. While anyone may
 * use this class to create transactional context, only with a reference
 * to the single instance may the owner of a task be changed, and only
 * trusted components are provided with this reference. Most components
 * outside the kernel will use the <code>TaskScheduler</code> or the
 * <code>TaskService</code> to run tasks.
