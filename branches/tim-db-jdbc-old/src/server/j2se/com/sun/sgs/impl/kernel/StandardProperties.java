/**
 * This class contains the standard property keys that the kernel looks for
 * (and may provide) on startup.
 * <p>
 * Note that when the kernel starts, it is given a list of application
 * <code>Properties</code> files, each of which represents a single
 * application to run. For each application, any of the property keys
 * identified here (except for <code>CONFIG_FILE</code>) will set the
 * associated behavior for that application. If no value is provided
 * for a given key, then the default or system-provided value is used.
 * Note that some keys are required to have values, specifically
 * <code>APP_NAME</code>, <code>APP_ROOT</code>, <code>APP_LISTENER</code>,
 * and <code>APP_PORT</code>.
 * <p>
 * Default values can be provided for all applications by using any of the
 * properties specified in this class at the system level (i.e., in a
 * system config file or as a system property). The one exception is
 * <code>APP_NAME</code>, which may not be specified at the system level,
 * and must instead be specified in each application's <code>Properties</code>
 * configuration file.
