/**
 * This implementation of <code>ResourceCoordinator</code> is used by the
 * kernel to create and manage threads of control. No component creates
 * a thread directly. Instead, they request to run some long-lived task
 * through the <code>startTask</code> method. All threads created and
 * managed by this class are instances of
 * <code>TransactionalTaskThread</code>.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This currently provides access to an unbounded number of threads.
 * A pool of threads is kept, but if the pool is empty and a new thread
 * is needed, it is always created. Also, there is no policy governing how
 * many threads may be allocated to any given component. This is fine for
 * an initial testing system, but will need to be profiled and understood
 * better in the final production system. For the present, this is meant
 * be a simple coordinator that provides correct behavior.
