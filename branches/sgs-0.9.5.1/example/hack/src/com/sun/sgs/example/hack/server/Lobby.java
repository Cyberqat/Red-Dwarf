/**
 * The lobby is where all players go to join a game, and it manages players
 * while they're deciding which game to join. The lobby maintains a list of
 * current players, as well as player counts for each of the games, and is
 * notified when those counts change. The lobby is responsible for telling
 * players this information when they join, and broadcasting any changes in
 * membership counts or available games. It also provides the interface for
 * managing <code>Player<code>'s characters. There is a single
 * <code>Lobby</code> instance for each game app.
 * <p>
 * While in the lobby all players are on the same channel, which is used for
 * chatting. Once moved into another game, players are removed from the
