/**
 * Represents a client's view of a channel.  A channel is a
 * communication group, consisting of multiple clients and the server.
 * <p>
 * The server is solely responsible for creating channels and
 * adding and removing clients from channels.  If desired, a client
 * can request that a channel be created by sending an
 * application-specific message to the server (using its {@link
 * ServerSession}).
 * <p>
 * When the server adds a client session to a channel, the client's
 * {@link ServerSessionListener}'s {@link
 * ServerSessionListener#joinedChannel joinedChannel} method is
 * invoked with that client channel, returning the client's
 * {@code ClientChannelListener} for the channel.  A
 * {@code ClientChannelListener} for a client channel is notified
 * as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When a message is received on a client channel, the listener's
 * {@link ClientChannelListener#receivedMessage receivedMessage}
 * method is invoked with the channel, the sender's session identifier,
 * and the message.  A {@code null} sender indicates that the
 * message was sent by the server.  The listener is <i>not</i>
 * notified of messages that its client sends on its associated
 * channel.</li>
 *
 * <li> When the associated client leaves a channel, the listener's
 * {@link ClientChannelListener#leftChannel leftChannel} method is
 * invoked with the channel.  Once a client has been removed
 * from a channel, that client can no longer send messages on that
 * channel.</li>
