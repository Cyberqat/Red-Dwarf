/**
 * This interface is used to schedule tasks to run. Unlike the
 * <code>TaskManager</code> interface used by applications, or the
 * <code>TaskService</code> interface used by <code>Service</code>s,
 * <code>TaskScheduler</code> is not transactional, and does not
 * persist tasks. To make a task transactional, you should wrap it
 * in <code>TransactionRunner</code>. To make a task persist, you
 * should use the <code>DataService</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that while <code>TaskScheduler</code> is not aware of transactions,
 * it does handle re-trying tasks based on <code>Exception</code>s thrown
 * from the given <code>KernelRunnable</code>. If the <code>Exception</code>
 * thrown implements <code>ExceptionRetryStatus</code> then the
 * <code>TaskScheduler</code> will consult the <code>shouldRetry</code>
 * method to decide if the task should be re-tried. It is up to the
 * scheduler implementation to decide if tasks are re-tried immediately,
 * or re-scheduled in some manner (for instance, scheduled at a higher
 * priority or put on the front of the queue).
 * <p>
 * The <code>scheduleTask</code> methods will make a best effort to schedule
 * the task provided, but based on the policy of the scheduler, this may not
 * be possible. To ensure that a task will have space in the scheduler,
 * methods are provided to get a <code>TaskReservation</code>. This is
 * especially useful for transactional <code>Service</code>s that need to
 * assure space to schedule a task before they can actually commit the
 * task to be scheduled.
 * <p>
 * In addition to individual tasks, the scheduler also supports recurring
 * tasks through the <code>scheduleRecurringTask</code> method. 
 * <p>
 * Tasks run on the <code>TaskScheduler</code> are expected to be short-lived
 * (on the order of 10s of milliseconds). To run a long-lived task, see
 * <code>ResourceCoordinator</code>.
