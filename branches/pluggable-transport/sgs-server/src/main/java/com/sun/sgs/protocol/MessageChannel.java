/**
 * A channel for sending protocol messages to a client.  A {@code
 * MessageChannel} is created by the {@link
 * ProtocolFactory#newProtocol ProtocolFactory.newProtocol} method.
 *
 * <p>Note: If the protocol specification (implemented by a given {@code
 * MessageChannel}) requires that a login acknowledgment be
 * delivered to the client before any other protocol messages, the protocol
 * message channel must implement this requirement.  It is possible that a
 * caller may request that other messages be sent before the login
 * acknowledgment, and if the protocol requires, these messages should be
 * enqueued until the login acknowledgment has been sent to the client.
 * 
 * <p>TBD: should reconnection be handled a this layer or transparently by
 * the transport layer?   Perhaps the {@code AsynchronousByteChannel}
 * managed by the transport layer could handle the reconnection under the
 * covers?
