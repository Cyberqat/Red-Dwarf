/**
 * A handler for protocol messages for an associated client session.
 *
 * Each operation has a {@code CompletionFuture} argument that, if
 * non-null, must be notified when the corresponding operation has been
 * processed.  A caller may require notification of operation completion
 * so that it can perform some throttling, for example only resuming
 * reading when a protocol message has been processed by the handler, or
 * controlling the number of clients connected at any given time.
 *
 * <p>TBD: should reconnection be handled a this layer or transparently by
 * the transport layer?
 *
 * <p>TBD: should a future be returned by the handler's methods instead of
 * supplied to them?
