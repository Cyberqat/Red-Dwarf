Remote profiler packs for NetBeans 6.1.

Downloaded from http://profiler.netbeans.org/
for the following platforms:

solaris-amd64	solaris-i386

================================================
Before profiling a run on a particular machine, you need to run the calibration
script on that machine (in lib/bin/calibrate.sh).

To use the NetBeans profiler on your current machine, open the project
under NetBeans and choose Profile->Profile Main Project.  It will ask
you which build.xml target you'll be using;  one has been provided:

 nb-profile-example-app-single-node

which includes the required changes.  This is an augmented version of the
example-app-single-node target.  Edit the target or create a new one as
necessary.

You'll be able to select a profiling type, start the profiling, and
take snapshots.  Snapshots allow different manipulations of the data
(be sure to right-click on the mouse when various items are selected
to see additional options).

More information is available at http://profiler.netbeans.org/.

=================================================
Remote profiling of a node removes the profiler GUI overhead from the code being
profiled.  To enable remote profiling of a node, set the start.profile property
in the Darkstar build.xml, e.g.:

 ant -Dstart.profile=true example-app-single-node -Dapp.properties=example/request/RequestApp.properties

The VM will come up, but will wait for the profiler to attach to it.

On a different machine, start NetBeans and open the Darkstar
project.   Choose the menu item Profile->Attach Profiler and
a wizard should come up.  Choose:

  Target Type:  Application
  Attach method: Remote
  Attach invocation: Direct
  
In the next screen, provide the host name you're
running the node on, and the Host OS (e.g.  dstar12,
Solaris (Intel).

The next screen summarizes your selections, and the last
screen gives details on how to start the remote application
so the profiler can attach to it.  These steps have been
incorporated into the build.xml (via property start.profile).
