/**
 * An interface which defines some common functionality for all 
 * <code>Quadtree</code>. A <code>Quadtree</code> is a data structure used to
 * partition 2-Dimensional space where each node has at most four children,
 * dividing a region into four sub-regions.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations need to use a "bounding box" to restrict elements to a
 * specific 2-Dimensional region to easily check if an element is within
 * a 2-Dimensional region and also to calculate how the bounding box region
 * should be split up to create new children representing sub-regions. The
 * bounding box is defined in terms of <code>double</code> cartesian
 * coordinate values. Here, an element is defined to "contained" within a
 * bounding box if its corresponding x and y coordinates are within the bounding
 * box's cartesian coordinate values, including if the element lies on the
 * edge of the bounding box. Since there may be many elements in the tree, 
 * defining a bounding box removes the need to walk through the tree to collect
 * and return all elements in an otherwise lengthy process.
 * There may be more than one element at a given location, therefore it is
 * infeasible to specify the characteristics of the object to be removed or
 * retrieved. Instead, individual removals can be achieved by using the
 * iterator's {@code remove()} method.
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to determine the number of elements stored at a given location, it
 * is necessary to create an iterator with a bounding box encompassing the
 * coordinate ({@link #boundingBoxIterator boundingBoxIterator(double, double,
 * double, double)}), or alternately, an iterator for the point itself
 * ({@link #pointIterator pointIterator(double, double)}). Note, the behaviour
 * of {@code pointIterator()} can be replicated using
 * {@code boundingBoxIterator()} by specifying a bounding box where
 * <code>x1==x2</code> and <code>y1==y2</code>.
 *
 * <p> Consequently, classes implementing this interface need access to a
 * class which implements the {@link QuadTreeIterator} to accommodate the
 * return value of {@code boundingBoxIterator()} and {@code pointIterator()}
 * methods.
 *
 *
 *
 * @param <E> the element stored in the Quadtree's leaves
