 * This abstract implementation of <code>Thread</code> represents all of the

 * running long-lived tasks. Note that these are the tasks run through this
 * interface, and not the short-lived tasks queued in the scheduler. The
 * <code>startTask</code> method on <code>ResourceCoordinator</code> should
 * be called infrequently, so <code>TaskThread</code>s will not be given
 * new tasks frequently.
 * <p>
 * This interface is used only to manage the current owner of this
 * thread, which starts as the owner of the initial task, but will be
 * re-set with each task run out of the scheduler. See
 * <code>TaskHandler</code> for details on this process.
