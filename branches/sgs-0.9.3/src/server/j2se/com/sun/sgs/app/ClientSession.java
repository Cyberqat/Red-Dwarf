/**
 * Interface representing a single, connected login session between a
 * client and the server.  Classes that implement
 * {@code ClientSession} must also implement {@link Serializable}.
 *
 * <p>When a client logs in, the application's {@link
 * AppListener#loggedIn(ClientSession) AppListener.loggedIn} method is
 * invoked with a new {@code ClientSession} instance which
 * represents the current connection between that client and the
 * server.  The application should register a {@link
 * ClientSessionListener} for each session logged in, so that it can
 * receive notification when a client session sends a message, is
 * disconnected, or logs out.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ClientSession} is used to identify a client that is
 * logged in, to send messages to that client, to register a listener
 * to receive messages sent by that client, and to forcibly disconnect
 * that client from the server.
 *
 * <p>A session is considered disconnected if one of the following occurs:
 * <ul>
 * <li> the client logs out
 * <li> the client is forcibly disconnected by the server by invoking
 * its session's {@link #disconnect disconnect} method
 * <li> the client becomes disconnected due to a network failure, and
 * a connection to the client cannot be re-established in a timely manner
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If a client associated with a {@code ClientSession} becomes
 * disconnected due to one of these conditions, the {@link
 * ClientSessionListener#disconnected(boolean) disconnected} method is
 * invoked on that session's registered
 * {@code ClientSessionListener} with a {@code boolean} that
 * if {@code true} indicates the client logged out gracefully.
 *
 * <p>Once a client becomes disconnected, its {@code ClientSession}
 * becomes invalid and can no longer be used to communicate with that
 * client.  When that client logs back in again, a new session is
 * established with the server.
