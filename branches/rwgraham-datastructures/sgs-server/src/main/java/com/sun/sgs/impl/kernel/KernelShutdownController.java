 * While this class is declared with public visibility, it can only be
 * instantiated with package access. In fact, the only class which should be
 * concerned with creating an instance is the {@code Kernel}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code WatchdogService} has access to the {@code shutdownNode()} method
 * when it decides that the node is to be shut down. This decision of whether
 * to shut down the node or not is left to be implemented. The default
 * behavior is to shut down the node when a service has reported a failure.
 * Future implementations may have the {@code WatchdogService} assess the
 * severity of the failure and make a decision based on the information.
