Sun Game Server Software Development Kit Version 0.9

INTRODUCTION

The Sun Game Server (SGS) is a system that enables developers to write
scalable, reliable, persistent and fault-tolerant game server
applications using simple single-threaded, event-driven code.

This kit contains everything you need to develop game servers that run
as applications in the SGS environment, and clients that communicate
with these servers and each other.

In addition to the documents, APIs and examples, this kit contains a
complete single-system version of the Sun Game Server.  The APIs in this
version are the same as those that will be included in the full-scale,
multi-node version of the system, which will be released in the
future. The current system allows development of games that run on a
single server. The server system will make use of the multi-threading
capabilities of that server when they are available.

CONTENTS

The SGS Software Development Kit (SDK) contains the following
subdirectories:

- doc
   All the documentation for the SGS except the tutorials

- lib
   JAR files and native libraries needed to develop for the SGS, and to
   run the server and client apps

- tutorial
   Documentation and sample code for the two SGS tutorials
	
To develop or run clients, include the following JAR file in your
classpath:

   lib/sgs-client.jar

To develop server applications, include the following JAR file in your
classpath:

   lib/sgs.jar

To run the SGS server:

1. Change to the directory containing the SGS installation, or set the
   SGSHOME environment variable to the installation directory and
   include that directory in your path

2. On Windows, type:

   sgs <path to application classes> <path to application config file>

   On all other systems, type:

   sgs.sh <path to application classes> <path to application config file>

   For example, to run the tutorial's HelloWorld example when running on
   Windows, assuming the SGSHOME environment variable is set to the
   installation directory, that directory is included in your path, and
   your working directory is the tutorial subdirectory of the
   installation directory, type:

   sgs tutorial.jar HelloWorld.properties

For more information, please see the tutorials in the tutorial directory
and the documentation in the docs directory.  Also check the
