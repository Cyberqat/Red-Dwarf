 * implement a constructor of the form (<code>java.util.Properties</code>,

 * <code>com.sun.sgs.kernel.TaskScheduler</code>,
 * <code>com.sun.sgs.kernel.ResourceCoordinator</code>).
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is not complete. It is provided as an initial
 * attempt to capture basic aspects of operation. As more profiling and
 * investigation is done on the system, expect to see the information
 * provided here evolve.
