 * listeners can be stored persistently.  If a given listener has
 * mutable state, that listener should also implement the {@link
 * ManagedObject} interface.

 * {@link Task} being executed by the {@link TaskManager}.  If, during
 * such an execution, a task invokes one of this listener's methods
 * and that method throws an exception, that exception implements
 * {@link ExceptionRetryStatus}, and its {@link
 * ExceptionRetryStatus#shouldRetry shouldRetry} method returns
 * {@code true}, then the {@code TaskManager} will make
 * further attempts to retry the task that invoked the listener's
 * method.  It will continue those attempts until either an attempt
 * succeeds or it notices an exception is thrown that is not
 * retryable.
 *
 * <p>For a full description of task execution behavior, see the
 * documentation for {@link TaskManager#scheduleTask(Task)}.
