/**
 * This class represents a single player (user) in the system. Each player
 * may have several characters associated with them, although typically a
 * player only plays one character at a time. There is never more than one
 * <code>Player</code> for each user, and the user may not be logged in
 * more than once.
 * <p>
 * In addition to managing the details about a player (their name, characters,
 * channel, current uid, etc.), this is also the point where all incoming
 * messages from the client arrive. This means that message receipt and
 * processing is all done while blocking on the <code>Player</code> rather
 * than some general processing logic. This model helps distribute
 * synchronization and also protect against a player trying to disrupt
 * the system.
