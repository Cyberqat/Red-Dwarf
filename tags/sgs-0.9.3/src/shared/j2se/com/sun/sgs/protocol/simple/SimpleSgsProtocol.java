/**
 * SGS Protocol constants.
 * <p>
 * A protocol message is constructed as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> (int) payload length, not including this int
 * <li> (byte) version number
 * <li> (byte) service id
 * <li> (byte) operation code
 * <li> optional content, depending on the operation code.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A {@code ByteArray} is encoded as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> (unsigned short) number of bytes in the array
 * <li> (byte[]) the bytes in the array
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A {@code String} is encoded as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> (unsigned short) number of bytes of modified UTF-8 encoded String
 * <li> (byte[]) String encoded in modified UTF-8 as described
 * in {@link java.io.DataInput}
 * </ul>
  * <p>
 * A {@code CompactId} is encoded as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <p>The first byte of the ID's external form contains a length field
 * of variable size.  If the first two bits of the length byte are not
 * #b11, then the size of the ID is indicated as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>#b00: 14 bit ID (2 bytes total)</li>
 * <li>#b01: 30 bit ID (4 bytes total)</li>
 * <li>#b10: 62 bit ID (8 bytes total)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If the first byte has the following format:
 * <ul><li>1100<i>nnnn</i></li></ul> <p>then, the ID is contained in
 * the next {@code 8 + nnnn} bytes.
 * </ul>
