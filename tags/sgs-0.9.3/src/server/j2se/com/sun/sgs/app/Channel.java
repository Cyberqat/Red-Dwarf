/**
 * Interface representing a communication group, a
 * {@code Channel}, consisting of multiple client sessions and
 * the server.  Classes that implement {@code Channel} must
 * also implement {@link Serializable}.
 *
 * <p>A channel is created by invoking the {@link
 * ChannelManager#getChannel(String) ChannelManager.createChannel}
 * method with a name for the channel, a {@link ChannelListener}, and
 * a {@link Delivery} requirement.  A {@link ClientSession} can
 * be added or removed from a channel using that
 * {@code Channel}'s {@link #join join} and {@link #leave leave}
 * methods respectively.  All client sessions can be removed from a
 * channel by invoking {@link #leaveAll leaveAll} on the channel.
 *
 * <p>The server can send a message to any or all client sessions
 * joined to a channel by using one of the channel's {@code send}
 * methods.  Note that the methods of this interface are invoked
 * within the context of an executing {@link Task}; as a result, a
 * message sent to client sessions using one of the channel's
 * {@code send} methods will not be sent until after its
 * corresponding task completes.  Messages sent on a channel will be
 * delivered according to that channel's {@link Delivery} requirement,
 * specified at channel creation time.
 *
 * <p>A client session can send a message to a channel only if it is a
 * member of that channel.  A client session sends a channel message
 * by sending a request to server using a protocol employed by the
 * implementation.  A requested channel message is delivered,
 * according to the channel's delivery requirement, to all requested
 * recipients except for the sending client session.
 *
 * <p>If a channel is created with a {@link ChannelListener}, then
 * when any client session sends a message on that channel, that
 * listener's {@link
 * ChannelListener#receivedMessage(Channel,ClientSession,byte[])
 * receivedMessage} method is invoked with that channel, the client
 * session, and the message.
 *
 * <p>If the server needs to receive notification of messages sent by
 * an individual client session on a channel, the application can
 * specify a non-{@code null} {@link ChannelListener} when
 * invoking the {@link #join join} method to add a client session to a
 * channel.
 *
 * <p> Note that no registered listeners are notified of messages sent
 * by the server on the channel; listeners are only notified (as
 * described above) when client sessions send messages on the channel.
 *
 * <p>A client session joined to one or more channels may become
 * disconnected due to the client logging out or due to other factors
 * such as forced disconnection or network failure.  If a client
 * session becomes disconnected, then for each channel the session is
 * joined to:
 * <ul>
 * <li> that client session is removed from the channel
 * <li> if an individual {@code ChannelListener} is registered
 * for that session, then that listener is unregistered from the
 * channel
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When the application is finished using a channel, the
 * application should invoke that channel's {@link #close close}
 * method so that its resources can be reclaimed and its named binding
 * removed.  Once a channel is closed, any of its side-effecting
 * operations will throw {@link IllegalStateException} if invoked.
 *
